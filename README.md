# CredentialProvider.Net6

This is a kind-of a fork of Steve Syfuhs' (Windows Credential Provider)[https://syfuhs.net/2017/10/15/creating-custom-windows-credential-providers-in-net/] project written in C#, updated from .NET Framework 4.6 to .NET6. It's bare bones, i.e. nothing on top of basic functionality of the original, except now it is in .NET6, allowing for further development and using up-to-date libraries.
